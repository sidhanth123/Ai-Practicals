AI Practicals üß†‚ú®
This repository contains a collection of Python-based Artificial Intelligence practical programs developed as part of an academic curriculum. The goal of these exercises is to demonstrate the implementation of core AI techniques in both traditional and modern areas such as search algorithms, NLP, and basic games.

üîç Practical Descriptions
P1: Breadth-First Search
A classic BFS algorithm implemented using a queue (collections.deque). Demonstrates graph traversal level-by-level from a given start node.

P2: Depth-First Search
Recursive implementation of DFS using a visited set. Useful for deep exploration of graph paths.

P3: 8-Queens Problem
Solves the 8-queens puzzle using backtracking and prints one valid configuration on a chessboard.

P4: NLP Tokenization & Stemming
Applies NLTK for:
1.Word tokenization
2.Stopword elimination
3.Word stemming using Porter Stemmer

P5: TF-IDF Computation
Calculates Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency using TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.

P6: Feature Extraction
Processes a text corpus using stopword filtering and CountVectorizer to generate a Bag-of-Words model.

P7: Naive Bayes Text Classification
A sentiment classifier using MultinomialNB with labeled data split into training and testing sets.

P8: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A two-player command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with win/tie logic.
